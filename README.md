# DevOps with Docker - Exercises Submission

## Overview
Welcome to the exercises submission for the DevOps with Docker certification training provided by the University of Helsinki in partnership with Eficode. This README serves as a guide for completing and submitting exercises related to Docker and container orchestration using Docker Compose.

## Course Information
The DevOps with Docker certification training offers a comprehensive introduction to container technologies, focusing primarily on Docker and Docker Compose. Containers provide a lightweight and portable means of packaging and deploying software applications. Throughout the course, you'll delve into various components of web services, such as reverse proxies and databases, and learn how to deploy them using Docker.

## Prerequisites
To ensure successful completion of exercises, please make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Access to a computer with admin/superuser privileges.
- A general understanding of software development concepts.
- Experience working with a Command Line Interface (CLI) of your choice, including basic commands for navigating the file system, running commands, and manipulating files.
- Basic familiarity with a programming language such as Python or JavaScript would be beneficial but is not required.

## Additional Resources
If you encounter difficulties or wish to deepen your understanding of the topics covered in this course, consider exploring additional resources. These may include online tutorials, documentation, or community forums related to Docker and containerization.
